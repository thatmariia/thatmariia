## Hi, I'm Mariia Steeghs-Turchina 🙋‍♀️

I have a weirdly mixed background in physics, machine learning, computer science, electrical engineering, and especially mathematics, with a focus on modeling 🤓

### What I do

- I work on computational neuroscience projects, particularly EEG modeling, at the University of Amsterdam

- I contribute to FOSS and open science at Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) by improving research software practices and promoting FAIR principles
